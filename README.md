explainable_ai_analysis(models['Random Forest'], X_train, X_test, X.columns.tolist())
```

#### Pipeline 2: LLM Agent
```python
# Property analysis
sample_property = df_engineered.iloc[0]
property_features = extract_property_features(sample_property)

# Find comparable properties
comparables = find_comparable_properties_advanced(sample_property, df_engineered)

# Generate LLM prompts
analysis_prompt = generate_comprehensive_analysis_prompt(property_features)
report_prompt = create_property_report_prompt(property_features, comparables)
